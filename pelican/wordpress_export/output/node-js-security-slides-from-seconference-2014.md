Yesterday I gave talk about node.js security during
[SEConference](http://2014.seconference.pl) here in Kraków. It was fun -
especially afterparty where we could do some nerd - talking about our
security concerns :)

Oh and that part:

me: "- hey, where did you get this [Dragon
Sector](http://blog.dragonsector.pl/) t-shirt?"

vnd: "- because I'm the member of Dragon sector"

me: "- LOL, that explains everything"

And I was wondering why this guy is called "[vnd](https://vndh.net/)" -
just like that one from Dragon Sector. It was so obvious - lolme ;)

Ok so now - slides:
