During last Linux Autumn conference ([check my recap
here](http://maciek.lasyk.info/sysop/2013/10/13/linux-autumn-2013-recap/ "Linux Autumn 2013 – recap"))
I won competition run by guys from the platinum sponsor - Samsung R&D
Centre. There were two topics to be covered - each on other interesting
aspect of Linux tuning. First one was about polishing Linux security and
the second - about speeding up the Linux boot process. I wrote answers
to both topics, but the latter was the winning one.

I was asked about my ideas that I used during that competition a few
times until then. So after yet another conversation I thought, that
maybe it's time to write those and make them public - why not - I didn't
discover the America - just wrote down some known facts ;)

So - I strongly believe that github is a good place to publish things
like that. I created 'concepts' repo where I'll push any ideas that in
my opinion is worth of it. Never mind if those are my own concepts or I
heard those on some conference. This way I'm publishing my "concepts"
notebook from my Evernote.

And one more thing. This competition was awarded with this beauty
Samsung Galaxy SIII (yes, it's only box; I already have exactly the same
phone, so this one is landing on E-Bay):
