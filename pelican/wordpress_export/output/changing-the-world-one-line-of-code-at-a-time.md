So - 2013 year is almost over. It's time for recap. It's time to ask a
question - what have I done for The Community?

I've been a programmer for the past 15+ years and sysop for 12+. I
always used free and open source software - like those from Apache
project, perl, php, python etc. And I've been using Linux for the past
16+ years. And this is this word about which I've been thinking quite a
lot lately: "using". Three years ago I took part in the LinuxCon Europe
conference (2011) at Prague. I met there many people, that inspired me
by the way they acted.

Until then when I hit some issue with software I barely reported it via
some Bugzilla to some project keepers. Barely... But then I realized
that those guys' way is great. Something is not working like You'd like
it to? git clone the repo, change, create pull request... wait - maybe
first meet guys and join project?

And that's what I did this year. I joined two great projects: [Fedora
project](https://fedoraproject.org/) & [Gnome
project](https://www.gnome.org/) And started contributing. How much time
does it cost me? It depends - there're weeks when I do nothing, and
there are those where I put 10 hours of effort to solve some problem or
create new functionality. And it feels really good :)

Moreover I created some github repos where I put my ideas, solutions and
more - because one should help others, right? :)

-   <https://github.com/docent-net/concepts> - concepts and ideas. why
    not make those public?
-   <span
    style="line-height: 12.997159004211426px;"><https://github.com/docent-net/dotcfgs> -
    some cfg files  
   </span>
-   <https://github.com/docent-net/SecureCentos> - this is not another
    secure Centos spin - just couple of cfgs implemented in the 'right'
    way
-   <https://github.com/docent-net/HitTheHeat> - I'd like my home to
    be intelligent. With ARMs help :)

Those are just some minors - majors are coming :)

So are you a contributor? No? Think about it! You don't have to be a
developer. Check this page of Gnome
project: <https://www.gnome.org/get-involved/> - you can help - and you
can make a difference :)

And now - just watch this one and charge your mental batteries - start
contributing!
