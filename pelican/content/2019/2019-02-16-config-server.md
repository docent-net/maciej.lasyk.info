Last year together with [Damian ≈Åukasik](https://twitter.com/dmnlukasik) we 
gave a talk about configuration management using Spring Cloud Config and some
Python / Rundeck / BASH glue for High Available deployment across AWS and 
Google Cloud. It was a case study from our work at Codewise.

This was a part of [Coredump conference](http://coredump.events/2018/) agenda.
