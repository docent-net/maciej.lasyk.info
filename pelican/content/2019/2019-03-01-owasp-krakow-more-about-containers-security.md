Two days before this event [Wojciech Dworakowki](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/wojciechdworakowski)
(leader of [Polish OWASP chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Poland))
asked me if I could prepare an emergency presentation on a very short 
notice as one of already announced and confirmed speakers lost his voice due to
a sickness. As I always try to support OWASP and have some practical knowledge 
and experience related to infrastructure security I agreed. It cost me only one
evening / 5h to prepare this presentation.

I must write, that I was positively surprised as I wasn't completely sure about
quality of slides, content and my pronunciation as I didn't have time at all
to practice (and I'm not a native, English speaker). Fortunately feedback I 
received was very positive, so thanks guys!

I published slides here (uninfected PDF for downloading):

By the way - I did it again - 2 years ago I gave an emergency talk at huge 
conference (Devopsdays Poland) on a 1,5h notice(!). You can view it 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPB51TmsUEY) - It also was far from 
ideal, but again - back then feedback was also good. During that time I was a
member of the conference program committee and basically one of speakers didn't 
appear and I had to replace him. I remember that I had to find a calm place
and having only 90 minutes prepare a 25min talk. Crazy stuff :D 

So - funny stories, that tell me that you never know the hour, so stay always
prepared. And public speaking is fun! ;)

Enjoy!
