Summary: A few words about SRE related talks I gave recently

Some time ago a friend of mine, who is a co - organizer of [Geecon](https://geecon.org/)
(thanks [Ags](https://twitter.com/ags313)!) asked me about giving a 
talk about "how to maintain applications on production".

So I thought that instead of some generic talk I'll work on a presentation 
where I would describe 
in details how we worked on reliability matters @[Codewise](https://codewise.com/).
And the story should be interesting to people, as our company is well known for
running low - latency, high traffic systems (400k requests/s total).

I run this presentation three times, second even as a keynote during 
[DevopsDays Poznań](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-poznan/welcome/) event.

The interesting part is originally this presentation was meant to tell a story
of a no-ops company running own Cassandra clusters, however after Geecon 
edition I changed it a bit and removed Cassandra - related slides, as it turned
out that people are very interested in reliability subjects but in a generic
approach (not focused only on one service).

So here are slides (videos are still not available): [click](https://github.com/docent-net/conferences/blob/master/2019-devopsdays-cassandra-sre-implements-devops/cassandra-sre-implements-devops-devopsdays.pdf)
