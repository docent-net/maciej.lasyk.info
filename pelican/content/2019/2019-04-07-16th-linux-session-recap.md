[16th Linux Session](https://sesja.linuksowa.pl) @Wrocław is a wrap and I must say that it was one of the best editions
from my point of view. I could finally stay for the whole weekend, enjoy discussions with most of attendees and learn
something new. And have a beer or two or more ;)

From all those talks I attended in I'd like to say that two draw my attention quite close:

1. **Performant filtering of network packets with BPF** by [Michał Rostecki](https://twitter.com/mrostecki?lang=en).
   Michał works around [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) at [Suse](https://www.suse.com/) and during his talk I learn a bit
   about how current state of network filtering works in Linux Kernel, what are different methods of filtering / routing
   and where to find one of the nest documentation about BPF (that is on Cilium documentation pages: [https://cilium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bpf/](https://cilium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bpf/)).
1. **Own email server - hows and whys** by Błażej Święcicki (Błażej, do you exist on internets at all? ;) ). This talk
   started interesting discussion about privacy of our communication. We learnt how it looks like to host own email 
   service these days. Personally I do host my own mail server thus I was interested in challenges Błażej had to accept 
   during last decade of maintaining Postfixes and making sure emails are properly delivered and received.
   
I was a speaker at this Linux Session for the 6th time - it's actually the only conference I attend so regularly -
thanks guys! So this time I talked about security of Linux containers (one more time). Slides are here:

Also I decided to prepare a lightning - talks. First about [sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle) and the
second one about my hobby which is a long - distance training and sport and how Linux
and open source software helps me with that. 2 years ago I finished [Norseman Xtreme Triahlon](https://nxtri.com/) - 
during this lightning talk I described briefly how I use [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org) for my workout 
performance analysis and planning, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for video analysis of my swimming stroke and 
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for audio editing and working on content of my 
[sport - related podcast](https://dlugodystansowy.pl).

Last but not least - some time ago one of [tweets](https://twitter.com/benbreardjr/status/1113122811042848768) draw my attention:

I liked this t-shirt very much, and as I always try to teach more and more people about good things of systemd therefore
I decided to prepare similar t-shirt for this event. Here it is (you can't really see the sentence, but believe me -it's
there ;) ):
