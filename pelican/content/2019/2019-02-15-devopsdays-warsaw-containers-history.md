Last year I gave a talk about history of Linux Containers during
[Devopsdays Poland](https://devopsdays.pl/).

Preparing this presentation was very interesting for me - I had to go through
quite a history of computing, understand business cases behind some
decisions and explain that to the audience. In the end it was a bit chaotic,
however feedback was great.
