Summary: My thoughts about moving to Discourse and Piwik

### Erm, what? ###

For the last couple of years I've been favorizing Open Source software. That's
why after many years of using [Disqus](https://www.disqus.com) for comments and
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) for statistics I've decided
to go Open Source.

### Why? ###

- Because it's open source
- Because I like hosting my services on my servers
- Because I value my privacy
- Because when I host something then it's on my rules

### Discourse ###

- This is Disqus alternative
- Official webpage: [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/)
- Install notes via **Docker**(!): [github](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md)

### Piwik ###

- This is Google analytics alternative
- Official webpage: [Piwik](http://piwik.org/)
- Install notes: [here](http://piwik.org/docs/installation/)

Piwik doesn't have official Docker images - I'll work on that within [Fedora Dockerfiles](https://github.com/fedora-cloud/Fedora-Dockerfiles) 
and maybe I'll try to push this as another official installation method of Piwik.
