That's it. [Linux Autumn 2014](http://www.jesien.org) is over. This year I finally decided to give a talk
instead of only listening and networking.

The subject of this talk was **Orchestrating Docker containers at scale**. As
this was first time Docker ever appeared on Linux Autumn Conference I decided
to explain basics of those containers and later jump into deeper water or
orchestration.

Thanks for all of you guys - it was really nice to hear so many good words
about the presentation! Hope to see you at [DevOPS meetups
@KRK](www.meetup.com/Krakow-DevOps/)!

Btw - Szczyrk and it's area are really great for hiking, MTB and running.
Could't resist those mountains so had a [30-km run on
Friday](http://www.strava.com/activities/216556430):
