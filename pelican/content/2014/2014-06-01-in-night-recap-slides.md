 First of all – this is a coolest event badge ever. Seriously – it’s awesomeness is about zoundsss! Thanks guys again for that!

So this night is over, I think we all had already enough sleep and now we’re able to do some recap. First of all – hard to say for me but this was my first IT night; somehow it happened that I couldn’t make it earlier (7 years to narrow it as this was 8th edition – lol). What was this night about? Everything that was somehow connected to IT topics; there were gaming consoles, Linux Millionaire – like trivia, throwing HDDs challenge, assembling PC challenge etc – all the things we did and we love or hate :) And of course – there were many talks given by awesome people (lol – including me) ;) But honestly – every one person who attended this night was really awesome – We could talk a lot with almost everyone and did not get bored :)

So – if you weren’t there – regret this all 365 following days and register to the next edition – it’s really a must – be event :) And for organizers – guys – you did a tremendous and great job – thank you for that!

My talk was about living and working in terminal. You can find this on Slideshare (embedded below). I also created GitHub project where I will develop those topics through the time. Wanna help? No prob – just ping me somehow ;)
