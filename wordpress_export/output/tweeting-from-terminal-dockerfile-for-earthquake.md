A couple of days ago i created Dockerfile that installs Earthquake
Twitter terminal-based client on the top of Fedora. It's working like a
charm. Today this dockerfile was added to the official
Fedora-Dockerfiles
repo: https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/dockerfiles.git/tree/earthquake

So have a fun. In order to use that just install Docker and follow steps
from the README.md file
