So this is it - Linux Autumn conference is over! We talked a lot, we
hiked a beautiful mountain, we drank a loot of beer and meet new people.
This year's edition was placed in the Szczyrk - heart of Beskid Śląski
and Żywiecki mountains - and weather was so great that i just couldn't
stay for all the talks inside the hotel and left for a while to take a
hike to the biggest mountain in the hood (see images & videos that I
shot on the end of this post).

The agenda was very interesting. I particularly liked:

-   <span style="line-height: 13px;">Pam\_container - LXC + PAM + Python
    = ♥ (by Grzegorz Nosek). This topic is very close for me as I just
    falled in love with LXC.</span>
-   Memory handling in Linux (by Maciej Nabożny). Performance topic are
    also very interesting for me - I spend a lot of time using strace /
    gdb on daily basis while developing some projects so it's always
    nice to hear something new or to take a look from one's perspective.
-   Smack - simple alternative to SELinux (by Rafał Krypa). I'm heavy
    SELinux user and also I just have to know about all the new
    security concepts. It was interesting but... I'll stay with
    SELinux ;)
-   Know Your Tools - auditd (by Dariusz Puchalak). I use auditd on
    daily basis so just wanted to see how others do it. I can say - we
    all use it the way developer thought - so the proper way ;)
-   Take care of my logs (by Witold Duranek) - this was very interesting
    talk about marriage of Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana and RabbitMQ.
    Really great - something I will have to take a closer look & deploy.
-   Technomonopols (by Michał Woźniak) - this was flame & troll fight
    about out understaiding of the biggest social services monopolies.
    Quite interesting - and despite I hate troll fights & flame wars -
    this one draw my attention.

I also won the contest announced by guys from Samsung R&D Centre. There
were two topics (improving Linux security and improving Linux boot
time). I won Samsung Galaxy S3 thanks to my ideas about shortening the
boot process time on Linux machines. I'll write another post about that.

Unfortunately I didn't make it to have a talk during this edition of
Linux Autumn. Due to that I changed my worked recently I had too much
things on my head and just weren't able to prepare enough. I created 2
short lightning talks (about node.js security and managing resources
with control groups) but unfortunately - there was no lightning talks
event so I couldn't give that presentations.

As I said - I love hiking the mountains so I took a trip to the summit
of Skrzyczne mountain. You can view the photos below. I also created 2
time-lapse videos using my SGS3 - you can see dusk and dawn over this
beautiful Skrzyczne mountain.
