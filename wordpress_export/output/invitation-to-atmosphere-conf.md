I'll give a talk at
[AtmosphereConf](https://atmosphere-conference.com/) - this event is all
about performance and scalability, the biggest one in Poland of this
kind. It remembers me about
[VelocityConf](http://velocityconf.com/) that I attended couple of years
ago.

I'll be there as a part of Fedora Project. And here is the abstract of
my talk:

#### *Scaling and securing node.js apps*

<div>

*After few years of node.js in operation we know it's very fast. We all
heard stories about backend services running with the help of node.js
and V8 core. But what we have learned about the security of such
applications? What are the major threats here? I'll explain how to
create node.js apps in a secure and reliable way. Also - I'll show how
those could be scaled easily with (or without) help of Linux containers
(Docker based) or jail - systems like Selinux Sandbox or libvirt
sandbox.*

There's still possibility to
[register](https://rejestracja.proidea.org.pl/registration/form.html?conferenceId=BD2C369D83E5939D36537511DF9E5D81)
- and this event is really full of great people and talks - just can't
wait till I'm there :)
