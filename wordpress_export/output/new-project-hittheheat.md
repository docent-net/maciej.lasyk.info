I've just created new github repo where I'll push all my materials /
scripts / schemas regarding to the project I started a while ago. This
is all about home central heating automation. I'm trying to create a
solution that will take care of turning the heating on / off based on
heating curve created with data gathered from Atmega nodes.

I'll keep you posted guys. for now You can check the pre - alfa code of
the Arduino app. I'll add more when I have some more time. You can check
it on the github project
