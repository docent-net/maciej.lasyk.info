Atmosphere conference was a blast! Those 2 days were full of talking,
arguing and thinking. Venue was really great - whole event took place in
the Praha Cinema in Warsaw and we had that feeling of \#RedCarpet party
;)

The Atmosphere Conference just like Velocity is all about scalability
and performance so DevOPS techniques and culture are all around the
place - you can literally feel those in the air. Also the event is about
people you meet there - and as the afterparty kept the Conference
standards (great organization, full of interesting people) I can only
say, that this is "must be" for all our polish DevOPS and others that
are taking care of scaling and polishing their platforms performance.

Someone asked me to compare Velocity and Atmosphere. Well - the latter
one is generally polish Conference where 95% of participants are from
Poland; yet this year lectures were mainly in english. And about
technological part - this year there were guys from Akamai, Facebook,
E-Bay, Chef, Percona, Prezi, Microsoft, some polish local businesses and
me - from Fedora Project. Looks like this conference is going global,
yup? :)

Oh and that running part - I stayed in a hotel just near to Lazienki
Park - one of the most beautiful city - parks in the Poland. So 6 am I
was already up & running through that alleys - I really recommend this
place to every of you that wants to keep in motion ;)

I'm really happy to had been part of the Atmosphere 2014. My lecture was
about scaling and securing node.js apps. Check those out:
