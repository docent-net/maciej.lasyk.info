It looks like I'll have once again talk at AA meetup (Anonymous Admins
group). I'll show you guys presentation I prepared for [11th Linux
Session](11.sesja.linuksowa.pl) in Wrocław about Ganglia and Nagios
integration. It was quite sudden as organizers asked me just yesterday
and announced today that I'll have this talk tomorrow. It'll be fun I
think ;) RSVP at http://www.meetup.com/AnonimowiAdmini/events/173718072/

Moreover this Friday I'll give a talk about node.js security. I'll cover
topics of securing server environment, creating backend services in a
stable and reliable & secure way and also I'll try to show some patterns
of insecure ways of delivering solutions based on node.js. Register
