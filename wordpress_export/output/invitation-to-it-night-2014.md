Today we'll have a fun during IT's night 2014. It'll take place here in
Krk in a great place called "The Wonder Years". Basically it's nerd -
event, where every one of us will be able to talk about things we can't
talk with our wives, bosses etc ;)

This event will be driven in Polish language; you'll find agenda
here: <http://nocinformatyka.pl/program.html>

I'll give a talk there - I'll show you guys how I live in the terminal
most of my time; what kind of tools I use and why I don't like to leave
the term. I named this lecture "Ghost in the shell" - I suppose you know
why ;)

So see you there today! Oh - my talk will take place at 1:50AM
;)<!--:--><!--:pl-->
