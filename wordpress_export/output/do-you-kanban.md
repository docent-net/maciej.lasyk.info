<!--:en-->**Introduction to Lean Management with Kanban in IT**.

Recently I gave a speech about using Kanban in Operations management
process. I prepared it the night before (It was like an emergency - I
had to fill the 60min gap in the 2-hours speech block), so didn't have
too much time (to be honest - I had only one night). I decided to
prepare it with [prezi.com](prezi.com) presentation engine - I've seen
it before and always wanted to go this unusual way. But I had a few
troubles with this engine:

-   I decided to prepare this "prezi" in polish language (right now I'm
    translating it into english). I could not use polish fonts under my
    Fedora 15 / Chrome - very weird. Normally I have no problems with PL
    fonts in Flash apps... and of course It was late night, so I haven't
    time to work on this problem
-   I wanted to download the offline presentation to be able to show it
    independently of internet connection. I was able to export it only
    as an exe file.. the only way to play it on my Fedora was to use
    Wine - It was ok until I tried to go fullscreen - app broken
    everytime (in all my 3 boxes I tried on - all on Fedoras)
-   Finally.. the speech was ok as I know from the participants, but one
    of the technical problems was a low framerate during slides
    transformations - and this is what the Prezi is all about (finally I
    played it with online viewer in prezi.com). I used Aces Extensa 5220
    with 2GB RAM, Celeron 1.73 GHz and Intel GMA X3100

Despite all this issues I will try to improve next time - I'll try to
solve the PL fonts problem and I'll also investigate the low performance
problem. Below I've embedded the PL version. When I've finished the EN
version I will add it below:
