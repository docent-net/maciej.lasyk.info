&lt;h1&gt;Focus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001 a friend of mine wrote me via IM one sentence which remains in my
memory up to now. It was about 1am and he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done nothing constructive for the last 30 minutes. I'm going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lost his focus. He was tired and started to procrastinate. He was my mentor
in the terms of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"&gt;Getting Things
Done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a student that times. For me it was rather normal to work until falling
asleep on the keyboard. I just couldn't tell myself "enough, go to bed"..
That's why that sentence was so important for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; technique
very helpful when having problems with concentrating or my plate is totally
full. Just find your way through &lt;strong&gt;pomidori&lt;/strong&gt; and after full set of 4 go
outside for 15-30 mins. That really helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Limit your WIP&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is taken from
&lt;a href="http://www.agileweboperations.com/kanban-wip-limits-the-fine-art-of-focus"&gt;Kanban&lt;/a&gt;.
I wouldn't be able to use Pomodoro having couple of tasks running
together. If I want to be efficient I have to &lt;strong&gt;remove any context switching&lt;/strong&gt;
and work only on one task at a time. Kanban or Scrum ensures that I can focus
on one particular job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Remove distractors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce"&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt; I can easily remove almost all
distractors simply by pressing &lt;strong&gt;F11&lt;/strong&gt;. That gives me fullscreen mode of
current window hiding any blinking icons in the system bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I removed any focus - stealing apps etc (e.g. Skype tried to get my focus
when receiving new message etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I learned to check all notifiers every single pomidori starts. So this
is the time I look at the calendar, e-mail, Skype and so on. Then I just put
down to the &lt;a href="https://workflowy.com/"&gt;Workflowy&lt;/a&gt; list of micro - tasks for this
day (reply e-mail, schedule meeting etc) and go on with the main job. So I can
use one of the pomidoris just for dealing with those micro - jobs (it's great
after lunch when feeling sleepy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also removed any notifications and LED blinking from all my cell - phones.
This was quite a huge time - saver. Even after work I just don't have this
feeling of checking that blinking LED. I just check my private e-mail like 5
times a day. It's enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Take control&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I felt like social networks were taking control over me. Having
Facebook app in the phone just made me poke around it almost unconsciously /
automatically. So instead of reading something valuable (like RSSes or Kindle)
I simply burnt my time on some bullshit. So I just removed all those apps from
my phone. It was fucking genius. No more bullshit, distracting myself etc. Time
saved - profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Isolate&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just buy yourself good head / earphones and use Spotify / Deezer. Working in an
open - space (or similiar) area is sometimes fatiguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Win&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup - with the ability to focus on my job I simply win my time. And that gives
me oppurtunity to do a lot more. Great win for anyone that is interested in
almost all field of life ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.. truly to be winners we have to practice all the time. Loosing focus is
very easy and kinda natural. So we have to control it. Good luck :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Maciej Lasyk</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:maciej.lasyk.info,2014-10-27:2014/Oct/27/focus/</guid><category>procrastination</category><category>focus</category><category>gtd</category></item></channel></rss>
