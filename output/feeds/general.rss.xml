&lt;p&gt;It could be a surprize that I won't mention here Facebook privacy policy. I'm 
rather open person on the web, so I really don't care about anyone stalking my
actions (as I rather keep private matters outside the Internet). It's about
trade - offs when you start exploring the web and create profiles on social
services - you sell a bit of your privacy and get back the possibility to interact
with other people who you don't have to know or cannot contact personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So - why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I realized that 4k of unread RSSes are awating me (this number grew because 
  of my FB activity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get almost nothing productive from FB - just people status updates etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found that I've been poking around FB without any self - control loosing 
  too much time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learn almost nothing from FB; percent of valuable posts is so low that
  it's irrational to name it "profitable"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the wider perspective - FB is just boring. I personally find interesting 
  only those informations that are educative so I can learn something new. Major
  of FB updates is just rumour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People tend to show themselves in the best possible situations, under bright 
  glare and we usually try to compare ourselves to them (this is how human is
  constructed imo). And this can lead us to frustration. Why would we do this to
  ourselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will I miss?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mainly contacts with people living far away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of companies instead of running own blog with RSS feed just use FB to
  post updates on events, promotions etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will I get?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to read RSSes -&amp;gt; valuable articles, updates etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More time to focus - less context - switching (yup, I caught myself on that 
  due to FB activity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~100mb of space on my phone ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll focus on this blog so there's non - zero chance that it will be more
  human - usable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was always a writer kind of person who likes to document events. FB is very
  bad when someones decide to post there story from a voyage because it will
  simply be lost after some time. Internet of things works better - when you 
  have your own webpage it is indexed by many serch engines and people can easily
  come back here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence that content I create will survive as it is hosted in a way I decide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Did I logout completely?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;. I uninstalled FB apps from my phone - thanks to that I just control my
level of dopamine during day :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover I removed login&amp;amp;pwd from the browser memory on my laptop - anytime I
want to check on FB I have to login manually. Lastly - I set up one-time-per-day
session of FB (~5min). Just to check on my family.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Maciej Lasyk</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 21:58:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:maciej.lasyk.info,2014-08-22:2014/Aug/22/logout-from-facebook/</guid><category>facebook</category></item></channel></rss>
