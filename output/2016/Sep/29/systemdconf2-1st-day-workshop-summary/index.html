<h2>systemdconf(2)</h2>
<p>So it's the second time <strong>systemdconf</strong> takes place. Again - in Berlin, which I find even more pretty in early Autumn 
than year before (which was in November) - sunny and warm.</p>
<p>Full schedule of this year's edition is <a href="https://cfp.systemd.io/en/systemdconf_2016/public/schedule/0">here</a>. Last year 
there was no workshops, but there was a hackfest on the last day. This time we have a workshop on the 0 - day (I call
it "0 - day" as this is an optional and needs an additional ticket).</p>
<p>So first 2 sessions were common for all attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demystifying systemd - Hands On</strong> by <strong>Ben Breard</strong></li>
<li><strong>Using the Journal Efficiently</strong> by <strong>Lennart Poettering</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Afterwards I found it very hard to choose between next sessions that were taking place in same time. I really wanted
to take part in <strong>Lukáš Nykrýn's</strong> workshop about <strong>systemd-nspawn 101</strong> and learn about <strong>mgmt</strong> from <strong>James Shubin</strong>.
But I finally chose almost 5 - hour session about <strong>Writing services the systemd way</strong> lead by <strong>David Strauss</strong>.</p>
<h2>Session 1: Demystifying systemd - Hands on by Ben Breard</h2>
<p>I was late almost 90 minutes as my coach bus was late almost 2 - hours (thanks to traffic jams on south entrance to 
Berlin). But I quickly synced to the rest of people thanks to <a href="http://people.redhat.com/bbreard/systemd/DemystifyingsystemdHandsOn.html">wonderful materials prepared by 
Ben</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to go through this workshop without using VMs but systemd-nspawn container instead. Thanks to this approach
I was able to create one container per workshop task in a quick and elegant way without wasting resources on KVM 
VMs or some other Vagrant abomination ;)</p>
<p>I found a little error in the materials for systemd-nspawn preparation. It should be:</p>
<p><code>sudo dnf --releasever=24 --installroot=/var/lib/machine/f24 install systemd passwd dnf fedora-release</code></p>
<p>Also I suggest creating this container under <strong>/var/lib/machines</strong> as this directory already has proper selinux type
(and we don't want to run with selinux disabled, yeah?)</p>
<p>Also I'd suggest installing following packages:</p>
<p><code>dnf install systemd-devel telnet telnet-server procps pkg-config make automake gcc git vim-enhanced iproute</code></p>
<p>And in the end - use this container as template for any following task from all the workshop sessions:</p>
<p><code>cp -R /var/lib/machines/f24 /var/lib/machines/f24-workshop1</code></p>
<p>I've published notes from this session on <a href="https://github.com/docent-net/systemd-conference-2016">my github</a></p>
<p>Generally speaking I'm very glad to attend this session - it was a wholesome recap of systemd basics!</p>
<h2>Session 2: Using the Journal Efficiently by Lennart Poettering</h2>
<p>This session was run by Lennart. If I were asked <strong>how to describe it in one sentence</strong> it would be: <strong>man systemctl
with Lennart's incredible comment and things that can't be find in man</strong>. I really loved it. And as usual - Lennart
explained the matter of logging w/journald so extensively that actually it was hard to even ask about anything.</p>
<p>Beside <strong>man systemctl</strong> things Lennart talked in details about unit's metadata (see <strong>-o verbose</strong> and all those 
uppercase params), cursors and gatewayd.</p>
<p>I've published notes from this session on <a href="https://github.com/docent-net/systemd-conference-2016">my github</a></p>
<p>Again - outstanding session.</p>
<h2>Session 3: Writing services the systemd way by David Strauss</h2>
<p>During this session we created a simple C application which later we converted into a systemd service with some
basic systemd functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>journald integration via sd_journal</li>
<li>monitoring / watchdog via sd_notify</li>
<li>socket activation </li>
</ul>
<p>Whole session was packed with coding, compiling, re - compiling and trying. It was very intensive, fast - paced and...
great! Afterwards we also saw corresponding <a href="https://github.com/systemd/python-systemd">python-systemd</a> wrappers.
Actually one of my ideas for Saturday hackfest is to rewrite this session's subject in Python in order to learn
how Python integration works.</p>
<p>Again - totally awesome session!</p>
<p>Materials for this session are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/systemd/tutorials/tree/berlin">Github</a>. Simply start 
with <strong>starter</strong> directory and apply logdaemon, watchdogdaemon and sadaemon on that starter content.</p>
<p>I didn't make notes during this session - there was no time, only coding and compiling.</p>
<h2>systemd-nspawn 101 by Lukáš Nykrýn</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't attend this workshops. However I asked Lukáš about materials - 
<a href="http://redhat.slides.com/lnykryn/systemd-nspawn-101#">he already published his slides</a></p>
<h2>Next Generation Config Mgmt: Workshop by James (purpleidea) Shubin</h2>
<p>And now for something completely different ;) Also - I couldn't attend this one, but I caught up day after with James
and asked about materials. However there're no dedicated materials from that workshops, you can basically hack around
mgmt basing on <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/">github project page</a>. This is very interesting project which needs
contributions (GoLang here) so if you're interested - go for it!</p>
<h2>So that's it</h2>
<p>Basically that's it. I have to say that I really like the idea of workshops and this day was 100% worth its price. I
was able to recap my systemd knowledge, update it, ask questions to people who actually develop systemd and understand
concepts which were not tha easy for me. Also I already have some implementations ideas that were born during those
workshops so - thank you guys!</p>
