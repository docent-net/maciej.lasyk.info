Summary: A few words about "Network Warrior" e-book

Some time ago I bought an e-book "**Network Warrior**" by **Gary A. Donahue**. As this
is rather a long reading (more than 700 pages) I didn't have enough time to
finish it. But right now - on holidays - once more I went through table of
contents and last chapter "**Avoiding Frustration**" brought my attention. I just couldn't
resist from reading this right - away. Those couple of pages consists of
author's experiences from years when he was still learning how to work in
bigger companies (corporate sizes) and how to collaborate with others being
the teamplayer.

Seriously - if you didn't read it yet - just read it. From table of contents:

1. Avoiding frustration
  1. Why Everything Is Messed Up
  1. How To Sell Your Ideas To Management
  1. When To Upgrade And Why
    1. The Dangers Of Upgrading
    1. Valid Reasons To Upgrade
  1. Why Change Control Is Your Friend
  1. How Not To Be A Computer Jerk
    1. Behavioral
    1. Environmental
    1. Leadership And Mentoring

Author described so many situations we face on daily basis in our work - and
what is important - he wrote how to react and behave so everybody is content
and our work is effective and goes in right direction. A totally "**must read**"
for everyone that have any doubts.
