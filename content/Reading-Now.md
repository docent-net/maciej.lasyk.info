Summary: Books I read during this holidays

### Reading It books during holidays? ###

**Are you insanse?** Someone could ask me this question, but seriously - 
during holidays I read just whatever I have on my list; I don't divide lectures
into "workdays" and "holidays". I just read what I'd like to read and what I'm 
comfortable with at the moment. And if those are IT books during holidays - it's
totally ok :)

### Mature optimization ###

[Mature Optimization](http://carlos.bueno.org/optimization/) by **Carlos Bueno** 
is a book which could be described the best using words of the author:

*I spent a good chunk of the last year working on an internal 
training class and a short book about performance measurement 
and optimization. My employer, Facebook, has kindly allowed me 
to release the book for free.*

### Docker Book ###

This is a full know - how about Docker containers. Anyone that thinks about
turning his infrastructure in the way of lightweight containers should start
with this reading. Nice to see [Scott Collier](http://www.colliernotes.com/)
as the technical reviewer. Scott works in **RedHat** on Openshift and Docker
(also [Kubernetes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes)). I
collaborate with Scott on [Fedora Dockerfiles](https://github.com/fedora-cloud/Fedora-Dockerfiles) project within [FedoraProject](https://fedoraproject.org).

This books imo lacks chapter covering cluster management subject, but as it
is (the book) still updated with new content I think that we'll have this
covered.

### Run or die ###

This is a story of one of the most famous skyruners of our times. He's still
amazing us with his new achievements. What can I say - this is a nice and easy
lecture I really wanted to read (thanks to my wife for finding this!)

### The Thriatlete's Training Bible ###

As I'm planning to start in my first thriatlon next year, all this year I'm
preparing for this event. The best way imo is to do the lesson and learn
about theory of proper training. I know the author **John Friel** for his
other books (especially [The Cyclist Training Bible](http://www.amazon.com/Cyclists-Training-Bible-Joe-Friel/dp/1931382212) 
and I really found those lectures very rich about good practices, training
sessions examples and whole training theory.

### 2 weeks ;) ###

...and couple ot thousands of pages to read & understand & make notes. Yeah ;)
