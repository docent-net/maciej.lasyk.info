Summary: Slides from my last talk I gave during Devopsdays Poland / Warsaw

The title of this presentation is borrowed from [Dan's Walsh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWGFqMuEHdw) 
presentations about security of Linux containers.

I worked on this presentation only for about 45 minutes. It was an emergency one - one of the speakers couldn't make it
to the Devopsdays Warsaw 2015 and I was asked to replace him on very short notice. 

Fortunately I had some slides from other events, merged
those very quickly, added some more and tried to improvise on the scene ;)
