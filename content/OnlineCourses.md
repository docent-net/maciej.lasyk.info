Summary: Short lsit of online courses, which I found usable & interesting

### What about onlince courses? ###

I've been using couple of online educational services (IT mainly) and wanted
to share a short list of those I used - with a little comment:

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - very rich courses library, mainly
  university level; ++ for mobile apps; courses are not self - paced
- [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) - Mainly webdev & mobiledev courses;
  sometimes I have feeling that videos are too childish; also not that many
  excercises to do; self - paced
- [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - like **CodeSchool** mainly webdev
  courses (and backend ones also); not that childish - I liked using this; 
  self - paced
- [LearnStreet](http://www.learnstreet.com/) - pity it's closed now; this was 
  really great service with many excercises and rich content; mentioning it
  because I really believe it will be live again; self - paced
- [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - didn't use this one, but my wife does ;) 
  self - paced, rich of wide angle - courses (not only IT)
- [ClassCentral](https://www.class-central.com) - it's rather an agregator of 
  many courses - engines (like **Coursera**). Worth mentioning as provides
  calendar of courses from many services
- [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) - very rich library of self - 
  paced IT courses; I've moved here as this one covers majority of topics
  that I wanted to learn about or retrain

I think that those services could be a solid base for development planning
in any company.
