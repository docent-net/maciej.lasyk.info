Summary: Write your presentations in Markdown!

One of the rules that stay assures my productivity is using same tools
for many tasks. That's why I've been looking for Powerpoint / LibreImpress replacement.

But it had to fullfill couple of requirements:

- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) based (so no need to learn new languages and could be created in VIM)
- Devops way - no clicking and fancy UIs, rather working in terminal
- No binary files so changes could be diffed easily (and VCSes make sense)
- Easy embedding of images

And it's here: [Remark](http://remarkjs.com/). Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnab/remark), simple to use, quite a community around.

Running those slideshows with use of:

```python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8001
```
