## Get yourself there! ##

Once again we're hosting [devopsdays event](https://www.devopsdays.org/) in
Warsaw, Poland, thanks to [Proidea](http://proidea.pl/) that takes care of 
organization.

I'm member of the programme committee - that means, that I had chance to work
with great guys on reading, accepting and filtering talk proposals as well
as setting up the final schedule.

#### Schedule ####

So what'll be there? Actually [you should see yourself](http://2016.devopsdays.pl/program/schedule/)
- the schedule is full of various talks. Thanks to that attendees will be able
to expand their knowledge - following the true devops learning path.

#### Ignite talks ####

If you feel like adding something, you wanna to show something - you may submit
[an ignite talk](http://2016.devopsdays.pl/cfp/ignites/form/) so you'll have
your 5 minutes on the stage. Great opportunity for all of you that something
to say.

#### Open spaces ####

We'll organize also [open - spaces discussions](http://2016.devopsdays.pl/open-spaces/). 
Idea is that you write down on a white - board subject / problem that you'd 
like to discuss with others, then those proposals are voted and those with 
most number of votes are chosen. Later we gather in small groups discussing
upvoted topics. 

#### Registration ####

[Registration is still possible.](http://2016.devopsdays.pl/faq/conference/)

#### FAQ ####

There's also [FAQ section](http://2016.devopsdays.pl/faq/conference/) where
you may find answers for not that obvious questions.

#### Parties! ####

Last but not least - we'll [have a before and after - parties](http://2016.devopsdays.pl/news/15/).
Actually those events are best place for meeting and talking to speakers about
anything. Speakers usually open themselves during those kind of parties, so
don't loose your chance! :)



See you there guys!
