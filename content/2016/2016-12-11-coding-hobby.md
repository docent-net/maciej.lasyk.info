I'm learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and reminding a bit of **C** as 
I'm working on some side - projects with **systemd**. I always believed that 
the only way to learn something is practise & repeat.

So I thought that I need some exercises. Found great service for that:
[https://www,codewars.com](codewars.com). You chose languages you want to
practise and started coding, earning points, honor and some other stuff.
Gamification here - I like it!

Every Kata provides some tests you may use, so [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
is in place. You may also create your own Kata and publish it. 

Try yourself. You may find me here: [https://www.codewars.com/users/docent-net](https://www.codewars.com/users/docent-net)
