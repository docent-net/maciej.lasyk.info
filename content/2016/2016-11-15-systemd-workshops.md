## The workshops ##

Since my last attendance to [systemd conference](https://conf.systemd.io/) 
together with [Marcin Skarbek](https://twitter.com/marcinskarbek) we've been 
thinking about running a systemd workshops in Kraków.

So actually during last [AA meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AnonimowiAdmini/)
we finally decided (Thanks Zuza!) to give it a go.

So it is! Probably on 26th November we'll host all - day hands - on workshops
in Kraków.

For more details see [workshop Github repository](https://github.com/docent-net/systemd-workshop)
or follow Twitter [#systemdkrkworkshops](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23systemdkrkworkshops) 
tag.

See you there guys!
