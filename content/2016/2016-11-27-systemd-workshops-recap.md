## Workshops ##

So as [I wrote before]({filename}/2016/2016-11-15-systemd-workshops.md) 
together with [Marcin Skarbek](https://twitter.com/marcinskarbek) we
run **systemd** workshops last Saturday. Venue was full, guys from 
[MegiTeam](http://www.megiteam.pl/) made sure everything was organized well -
it was just like it should be - thank you all :)

## Can I see what you learned? ##

Sure, everything is explained in [github repo](https://github.com/docent-net/systemd-workshop).

## Will you do it again? ##

There've been questions if we could run those workshops one more time. So
actually yes. We're thinking about 2nd round before end of this year. Simply
follow Twitter tag [#systemdkrkworkshops](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23systemdkrkworkshops)
(or this blog's RSSes).

## Anything more? #learningsystemd! ##

Yes. Considering that systemd is huge and learning it is a long journey I
decided to create **learning-systemd** tag in this very blog (and Twitter tag
[#learningsystemd](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23learningsystemd&src=typd))
I'll use it for blog post I'll create on this very topic. And I plan to post 
often :)
