### Evernote and Kindle? ###

I use Kindle as my main database for any books, articles or whatever I'd like
to read. I try to push anything (pdfs, notes from meetings etc) to my Kindle
so I'm always sure that nothing stays unread (that's a part of my GTD 
approach).

But also I use Evernote for storing all my knowledge, experiences, "to-read"'s
etc. It's basically huge database of everything / anything I'd like to
preserve.

Using Evernote you'll surely hit the [https://evernote.com/webclipper/](Evernote Web clipper).
It's a browser plugin which main job is to save particular pages in Evernote.

### So howto Kindle & Evernote? ###

I searched for a way to basically send any page directly from Evernote Web
Clipper to my Kindle (for future reading). And this time **I didn't want to
create my own solution** (which would be probably easy to implement: connect via
[https://dev.evernote.com/doc/](Evernote API), fetch any new notes marked for
Kindle use (e.g. by tags), send to Kindle e-mail address).

So I found [http://en2kindle.com](en2kindle). It's very simple tool - just authorize it to
read your notes within Evernote and then authorize it to be a legit sender to
your Kindle mailbox. Now just decide wheter you'd like to have all notes from
particular notebook sent to your Kindle or rather only those notes tagged with
some particular tag.

And that's all!

Enjoy and support en2kindle - it's ony $6/year!

Oh one more thing for people concerning about **security**. It simple as that -
it's as secure as keeping data in Evernote. It's internet - deal with it.
