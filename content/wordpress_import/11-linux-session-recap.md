11th edition of Linux Session is over. It was 2 days full of great
presentations, discussions and liters of beer we drank. I really enjoyed
"Self - hosting in practice" by *Błażej „Mewp” Święcicki. *I just felt
like this guys was talking about me, my home - server and my solutions
:) Unfortunately I didn't make it to "Linux namespaces: not only LXC"
by *Wirkijowski Wojciech* as I was late due to some accident on highway
which caused my delay.

Also I gave 2 talks during this conference - honestly it was my first
time to give 2 speeches during one event. It wasn't that easy to
prepare, but in the end I felt very good that I had that chance :) See
yourself the slides:
