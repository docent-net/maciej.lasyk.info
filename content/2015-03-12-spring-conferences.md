### Spring is near, so conference season is almost here! ###

As a friend of mine [Jarek Pa≈Çka](https://twitter.com/j_palka) told me 
yesterday - this is like a snowball. You give your first talk, then next and
next and you event don't blink an eye and you find yourself in a place where
some year you have 5 talks scheduled in a row during one month.

But.. I really do like it. Conferences are great. Just like a sport - you
prepare, train, test, rest and again over and over again. Then there is this
day where you can finally unleash accumulated endorphines and let yourself into
this flow of talks, discussions, chip-chats and off-the-record confabulations
;)

And then there is it. Couple of weeks later someone tries to get hired in your
company just because your presentation showed guys that it is really a good
place. Months later it appears that your idea was developed more and someone
else in some other event talks about it. There is more - you can attract people
to any Open-Source project you want - just tell them why it rocks!

Also it is the only place when you can actually meet the fundaments of our IT
world. One of my biggest dreams was photo w/Linus Torvalds. And here it is
(taken 3 years ago at LinuxCon Barcelona):

Ahh I simply <3 that. Also I do love travelling w/my pair of running shoes
getting up @6:00 just to have a morning portion of endorphines before starting
next conference day on a route I completely don't know.
