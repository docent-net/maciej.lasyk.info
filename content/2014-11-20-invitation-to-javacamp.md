Once again I'll have a talk about Docker cluster management. This time it will
take place in the Sabre office here in Krk and will be part of the JavaCamp #13
meeting which details are on the [meetup
webpages](http://www.meetup.com/Polish-Java-User-Group/events/213331502/)

So - see you there!

Can't make it? This talk is available on the youtube (not exactly this, but
same subject which I presented on Linux Autumn Conference):
