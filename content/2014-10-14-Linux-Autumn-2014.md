My speaker - break is over. Another major conference on the horizon. This time it's one of
the biggest Linux Conferences here in Poland.

I'll talk there about taking next step in automation of Linux containers
([Docker](http://docker.io) based) - cluster management based on [Fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet)
and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes). Also will
tell couple of words about [fig](http://www.fig.sh/) and history of scaling webapps.

Still not sure if you should attend? Check this year's
[agenda](http://www.jesien.org/2014/pl/agenda) and great
[location](http://www.jesien.org/2014/en/hotel) of the event! Remember to take
a bike (great mtb and road trails there) or running shoes - this is one of the
best places to have a workout :)

See you there guys!
